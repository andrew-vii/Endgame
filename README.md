# Endgame
Simple web-based CTF for beginners


This is a basic-level, web-based capture-the-flag challenge that I put together as a part of a recruiting trip for my employer. It was also shortly before the release of Avengers Endgame, hence the Thanos memes and quotes.

The target audience is high-school aged folks with basic computer science skills, but minimal exposure to CTFs. The first three levels (0-2) should be fairly easy for that demographic to solve or figure out, but the last level (3) will be a more difficult one to figure out. The levels cover basic html and Javascript coding, basic crypto math, and binary/hexadecimal character encoding. I'm sure the pages are vulnerable to all sorts of XSS and command injection as well as the vulnerabilities that I purposefully built in, but those are beyond the scope of the audience that I built it for. 


To get it set up, download the project files to a readable/writeable directory. Then, run the setup script (with root permissions), which should move the files to the correct locations, and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The webserver requires apache2 and php to function properly.
